# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import math to use the builtin fuctions for calculations
### Step 2: 
Get the list as a input from the user or enter the elements directly 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance with two decimal points
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
  
Distance between two points

```
import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])*2+(list2[1]-list1[1])*2)
print("%.2f"%distance)
```
